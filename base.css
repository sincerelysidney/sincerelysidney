/* 	Hi! I'm a CSS comment! I'm not code and I wont show up on 
	your website, but I'm still helpful! You can use me to 
	make notes about your code, write down ideas, or scream into
	the void. Typically, though, I'm used for notes :) 
	I can go across multiple lines!
	Just like (most) of the code you write, I have a beginning tag 
	and an ending tag (the asterisk and slash!) don't forget to use
	both otherwise you could cause some problems for your site! */
