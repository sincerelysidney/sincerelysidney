		filler text is really important because it helps you see what your website will look like once you've put content on it. most web developers use this thing called 'lorem ipsum', which is just a bunch of fake latin gibberish, as filler text. because webdev is kinda new to you, I'm gonna write my own filler text and use it to explain what's going on. blah blah blah I should have some longer words in here so I know how my text wraps what are some long words. asparagus. biblioteca. sincerelysidney. hereisareallylongword. okaycoolmovingon.
